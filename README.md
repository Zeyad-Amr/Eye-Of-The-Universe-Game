## Overview

This project is a solution for `Learning Through the Looking Glass` challenge which is to develop a game to help people learn about the `James Webb Space Telescope`â€™s amazing capabilities.

<br>

> Our game is divided into 4 stations: Discovery, Puzzle Game, Memory Game and PSF, and 5 levels, each level has a new image captured by James Web Telescope to be opened to the player to play with it in the stations.
