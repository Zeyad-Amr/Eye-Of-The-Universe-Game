The Carina Nebula is a massive cloud of dust and gas located about 7,500 light-years away from Earth where stars are both forming and dying, And JWST's view of the nebula, which combines near-infrared and mid-infrared light, offers a whole new look at its activity.<br/>
Webb’s seemingly three-dimensional picture looks like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening.<br/>
In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity, and the tallest “peaks” in this image are about 7 light-years high.<br/>
Webb reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars that are completely hidden in visible-light pictures.<br/>
Because of Webb’s sensitivity to infrared light, it can peer through cosmic dust to see these objects.
