The Carina Nebula is a massive cloud of dust and gas located about 7,500 light-years away from Earth where stars are both forming and dying.
It looks like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening.
In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity, and the tallest “peaks” in this image are about 7 light-years high.
