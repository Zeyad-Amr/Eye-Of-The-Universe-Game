Deepest Infrared image of universe yet offering a view of the early universe to date.\nThis image is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length, a tiny sliver of the vast universe.\nThis image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\nThis is taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) totaling 12.5 hours – achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields, which took 2 weeks which is extraordinary! And this is only the beginning.\nThe data also revealed light from one galaxy that traveled for 13.1 billion years before Webb's mirrors capture.
