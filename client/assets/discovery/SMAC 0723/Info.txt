Deepest Infrared Image of Universe Yet offering a view of the early universe to date

This image is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length, a tiny sliver of the vast universe.

This image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.

This deep field, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours – achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields, which took 2 weeks which is extraordinary! And this is only the beginning. Researchers will continue to use Webb to take longer exposures, revealing more of our vast universe.

The data also revealed light from one galaxy that traveled for 13.1 billion years before Webb's mirrors capture.

Using these detailed photos, Researchers will soon begin to learn more about the galaxies’ masses, ages, histories, and compositions.
