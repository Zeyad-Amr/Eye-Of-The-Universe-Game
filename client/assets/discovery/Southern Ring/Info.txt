NASAâ€™s James Webb Space Telescope has revealed for the first time that this scene has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years in all directions.\nIt is approximately 2500 light years away.\nPlanetary nebulae are the final stage in the lives of intermediate-mass stars that evolve away from the main sequence and expand into red giants.\nIn the late red giant phase, the stars periodically expel layers of material and ultimately end up surrounded by huge shells of gas and dust.\nAs an observation of the difference betweeen Webb and other telescopes it that the quality of the photo and details taken, It will also allow astronomer to dig into many more specifics about planetary nebulae (clouds of gas and dust expelled by dying stars) like this one.\nEach shell the star puffed off gives researchers the ability to precisely measure the gas and dust that are present within it.\nThe white dwarf has a surface temperature of about 100,000 kelvin, The hot surface of the faint star is heating the gas in the nebula.\nThe central star has expelled at least eight layers of dust and gas over the last several thousand years.\n
In thousands of years, these delicate layers of gas and dust will dissipate into surrounding space.
