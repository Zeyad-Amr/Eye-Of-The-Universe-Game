          "Taken in July 11, 2022. The Carina Nebula is a massive cloud of dust and gas located about 7,500 light-years away from Earth where stars are both forming and dying. And JWST's view of the nebula, which combines near-infrared and mid-infrared light, offers a whole new look at its activity. Webb’s seemingly three-dimensional picture looks like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening. In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity, and the tallest “peaks” in this image are about 7 light-years high. Webb reveals emerging stellar nurseries and individual stars that are completely hidden in visible-light pictures. Because of Webb’s sensitivity to infrared light, it can peer through cosmic dust to see these objects.",

          "IC 5332, also known as PGC 71775 is an intermediate spiral galaxy about 30 million light-years away. As viewed from earth it is nearly face on. It has a very small central bulge and open spiral arms accounting for its classification (SABc). The galaxy lies in the direction of the galactic south pole.",

          "Deepest Infrared Image of Universe Yet offering a view of the early universe to date. This image is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length, a tiny sliver of the vast universe. This image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago. This deep field, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours – achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescope’s deepest fields, which took 2 weeks which is extraordinary! And this is only the beginning. Researchers will continue to use Webb to take longer exposures, revealing more of our vast universe. The data also revealed light from one galaxy that traveled for 13.1 billion years before Webb's mirrors capture. Using these detailed photos, Researchers will soon begin to learn more about the galaxies’ masses, ages, histories, and compositions.",

          "The dimmer star at the center of this scene has been sending out rings of gas and dust for thousands of years in all directions, and NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has revealed for the first time that this star is cloaked in dust. It is approximately 2500 light years away. Planetary nebulae are the final stage in the lives of intermediate-mass stars that evolve away from the main sequence and expand into red giants. In the late red giant phase, the stars periodically expel layers of material and ultimately end up surrounded by huge shells of gas and dust. This observation shows the Southern Ring Nebula almost face-on, but if we could rotate it to view it edge-on, its three-dimensional shape would more clearly look like two bowls placed together at the bottom, opening away from one another with a large hole at the center. As an observation of the difference betweeen Webb and other telescopes it that the quality of the photo and details taken, It will also allow astronomer to dig into many more specifics about planetary nebulae (clouds of gas and dust expelled by dying stars) like this one. Since planetary nebulae exist for tens of thousands of years, observing the nebula is like watching a movie in exceptionally slow motion. Each shell the star puffed off gives researchers the ability to precisely measure the gas and dust that are present within it. The white dwarf has a surface temperature of about 100,000 kelvin. The hot surface of the faint star is heating the gas in the nebula. As the star ejects shells of material, dust and molecules form within them – changing the landscape even as the star continues to expel material. The central star has expelled at least eight layers of dust and gas over the last several thousand years. The shells allow astronomers to study the history of the system. In thousands of years, these delicate layers of gas and dust will dissipate into surrounding space.",
